<h1>Where My Story Began</h1>
<p class="lead">A deep, emotional chapter from the life of Malam Expensive (Mustapha Ibrahim).</p>


<article class="story-full">
<p>Every story has a beginning. Mine started in a small place, where the world felt big, loud, and sometimes confusing. I didn’t grow up with everything, but I grew up with enough — enough hope, enough courage, and enough dreams to push me forward.</p>
<p>People always ask where confidence comes from. For me, it came from struggle. From the days when things didn't make sense. From nights when sleep didn’t come easy. From moments when life humbled me and forced me to grow faster than I wanted.</p>
<p>But that beginning — that humble start — became my power. Because when you come from little, every step forward feels like victory.</p>


<h2>The First Lesson</h2>
<p>I learned early that nobody will hand you greatness. You create it. You build it. You rise into it. And that mindset became the foundation of everything I am today.</p>


<p>And this is just the beginning. The rest of the story? I’m still living it. I’m still becoming. Still growing. Still expensive.</p>
